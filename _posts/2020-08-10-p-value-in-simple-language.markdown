In symbolic form:
<div>$$
\text{p-value} = P(\text{observed data} \, | \, H_0 \text{is true})
$$</div>

<br/> <br/> <br/>
In simple layman terms: 
### The p-value is the probability that the null hypothesis is true.

<br/> <br/> <br/>
More correctly:
### The p-value is the probability that we obtained the observed data by random chance.

<br/> <br/> <br/>
A little more technical:
### The p-value is the probability of obtaining the observed data, if the null hypothesis was correct.

<br/> <br/> <br/>
Wikipedia definition:
### The p-value is the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the results actually observed, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is correct. 
### A very small p-value means that such an extreme observed outcome is very unlikely under the null hypothesis.
