### Problem 1:

The birth weights of newborn babies in the United States follow a normal distribution with a mean of \\(3.4\text{ kg}\\) and a standard deviation of \\(0.6\text{ kg}\\). Researchers interested in studying how children gain weight decide to take random samples of \\(100\\) newborn babies and calculate the sample mean birth weight \\(\bar{x}\\) for each sample.

**Calculate the mean (\\(\mu_{\bar{x}}\\)) and standard deviation (\\(\sigma_{\bar{x}}\\)) of the sampling distribution of \\(\bar{x}\\).**
<br/> <br/> <br/>

<hr/>

### Solution:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu_{\bar{x}} &= 3.4 \text{ kg} \\[2ex]
\sigma_{\bar{x}} &= \frac{0.6}{\sqrt{100}} = 0.06 \text{ kg} \\[2ex]
\end{aligned}

### Problem 2:

A machine automatically dispenses a beverage of a desired size. When set to "small," the machine dispenses varying amounts of liquid with a mean of \\(275 \text{ mL}\\) and standard deviation of \\(10\ \text{ mL}\\). Suppose that we take random samples of \\(5\\) of these drinks and calculate the mean amount of liquid \\(\bar{x}\\) in each sample. We can assume that individual drinks are independent.


**Calculate the mean (\\(\mu_{\bar{x}}\\)) and standard deviation (\\(\sigma_{\bar{x}}\\)) of the sampling distribution of \\(\bar{x}\\).** <br/>
_You may round to one decimal place._
<br/> <br/> <br/>

<hr/>

### Solution:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu_{\bar{x}} &= 275 \text{ mL} \\[2ex]
\sigma_{\bar{x}} &= \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} \approx 4.5 \text{ mL} \\[2ex]
\end{aligned}
$$

### Problem 3:

Lucille has a collection of more than \\(500\\) songs on her phone that have a mean duration of \\(215\\) seconds and a standard deviation of \\(35\\) seconds. Suppose that every week she makes a playlist by taking an SRS (Simple Random Sample) of \\(49\\) of these songs, and we calculate the sample mean duration \\(\bar{x}\\) of the songs in each sample.


**Calculate the mean (\\(\mu_{\bar{x}}\\)) and standard deviation (\\(\sigma_{\bar{x}}\\)) of the sampling distribution of \\(\bar{x}\\).**

<br/> <br/> <br/>

<hr/>

### Solution:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu_{\bar{x}} &= 215 \text{ seconds} \\[2ex]
\sigma_{\bar{x}} &= \frac{35}{\sqrt{49}} = 5 \text{ seconds} \\[2ex]
\end{aligned}
$$

### Problem 4:

*Source: [Khan Academy](
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/sampling-distribution-ap/sampling-distribution-mean/e/mean-standard-deviation-sample-means)*

A small school with \\(60\\) total students records how many of their students attend school on each of the \\(180\\) days in a school year. The mean number of students in attendance daily is \\(55\\) students and the standard deviation is \\(4\\) students. Suppose that we take random samples of \\(5\\) school days and calculate the mean number of students \\(\bar{x}\\) in attendance on those days in each sample.

**Calculate the mean (\\(\mu_{\bar{x}}\\)) and standard deviation (\\(\sigma_{\bar{x}}\\)) of the sampling distribution of \\(\bar{x}\\).** <br/>
_You may round to one decimal place._
<br/> <br/> <br/>

<hr/>

### Solution:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu_{\bar{x}} &= 55 \text{ students} \\[2ex]
\sigma_{\bar{x}} &= \frac{4}{\sqrt{5}} \approx 1.8 \text{ students} \\[2ex]
\end{aligned}
$$
