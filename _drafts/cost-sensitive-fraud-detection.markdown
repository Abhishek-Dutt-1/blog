Problem:

Assume we have a classifier that produces a score between 0 and 1 for the probability of a particular loan application being fraudulent. In this scenario: a) what are false positives, b) what are false negatives, and c) what are the trade-offs between them in terms of dollars and how should the model be weighted accordingly?
