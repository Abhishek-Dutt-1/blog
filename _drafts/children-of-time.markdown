3 / 5 Stars

Above average scify, humans egos fighting each other even when humanity is about to be extinct.
Spiders evolve from insects to intelligent society with poiltics and radio communications.
Both speices want the same planet.

Central conflict is the planet inhabited by the spiders which the last remaining humans want for themself.

Interesting characters, Captain is driven singleminded and has to make difficult decisions, he is like a villan but you can understand his motives, which is to save the humanity at any cost.

Another one is the Doctor who protects the planet as a God, and dosent considers these last humans as worthy and dosent allows them to land on the planet.

One small group does manages to land on the planet and meets the Spiders, that small chapter of the story was interesting.

Evolution of the spiers was a bit too detailed and got boring, could have been rushed.

Not super entertaining but can read one time, maybe its sequel Childre of Ruin is better.

This one got Asimove's award, many people like it enough.
