## Hello!

I am Abhishek. 

This blog is a data lake of my mind.

Information here has been collected from various sources on the internet.

Some are my original thoughts as well.

I write on topics related to:
- Data Science / Machine Learning
- Algorithms & Data Structures
- Coding Interview Questions

Aim to over-explain and ELI5 the topics in a simple language.

Very little background knowledge is assumed from the reader.

Check out **[Post Index]({{site.baseurl}}{% link post_index.md %})** for more organized list of posts in this blog.

Know more [About Me]({{site.baseurl}}{% link about.md %}) if you are curious.

### Thanks!
